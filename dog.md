THE ESSENTIALS, ON ONE PAGE
WELLNESS
Exercise and mental stimulation are crucial for the
wellbeing of your dog. As well as providing the
right amount of exercise for their breed and age,
provide toys and play games that mentally
stimulate your dog. Food puzzle toys are great to
keep your dog busy while you’re out of the house.
TRAINING
• Use positive reinforcement techniques (praise
and reward for good behavior) rather than
punishing bad behavior. Positive reinforcement
training is proven to be more efective, and helps
develop the bond between you and your dog.
• Train frequently in short sessions (5-10 mins).
• We encourage crate training; it’s linked to a
number of positive behavioral benefits, and
provides a safe space for your pet to rest.
• Never let your dog of the leash until they have
mastered recall, and only in safe locations like
enclosed parks and hiking trails.
MEDICAL CARE
• At your first appointment, we’ll go over your
pup’s personalized wellness care schedule,
including vaccine due dates, as well as
discussing nutrition, exercise, lifestyle and other
wellness factors specific to your dog.
• Remember to administer flea, tick and
heartworm preventatives every month.
• Regularly brushing your dog’s teeth is essential
to combat dental disease later in life. Get your
dog used to brushing early - read our guide on
page 33.
• We strongly recommend you consider pet
insurance, to help plan for the unexpected.
NUTRITION
• Begin by feeding your dog the food they are
used to. If you want to change brands, do so
slowly of the course of a week or so by slowly
providing less of the previous food and more of
the new food.
• Make sure your pet’s food contains an AAFCO
statement of nutritional adequacy for your
dog’s life stage.
• Check out our list of recommended food brands
on page 17.
• Don’t go overboard with treats; they should
make up no more than 10% of your dog’s calorie
intake to ensure they’re getting the right nutrient
balance. Consider giving pieces of your dog’s
regular kibble as training treats.
PREPARING YOUR HOME
Make sure you’ve got all the essentials before you
bring your new dog home. As well as the usual
supplies, ensure you have:
• A crate with a cosy bed
• The type of food they are used to, to avoid an
upset stomach)
• A few toys
• Something for them to cuddle up with, like a
blanket or t-shirt that smells familiar
SOCIALIZATION
Socialization involves getting your pet used to new
sights, sounds, smells and experiences. Carry
pups outside until they are fully vaccinated, and
begin exposing them to lots of diferent people
and other animals as early as you can. Gently
touch and handle their paws, ears, belly and tail
frequently.
Dog Parenting 101 | Page 4
Before you bring your new dog home, there are a
few things you should do to prepare.
1. Ensure you’re fully equipped
Make sure you’ve got all the necessary essentials
to help your dog settle in. You’ll need:
• A crate with a cosy bed
• Food and water bowls
• Food and treats (ideally the food that they’re
used to, to avoid an upset stomach)
• A few toys (check out our suggestions on pg. 22)
• A collar & leash. Also consider a harness if you
know they pull on the leash, or if they’re a breed
where their collar may slip over their head (e.g.
dachshund, whippet, greyhound)
• ID tag with their name, your name and contact
information
• Poop bags, and indoor pee pads if appropriate
• Cleaning essentials for accidents – cleaning
sprays specifically for dog messes can help to
eliminate scents and reduce the likelihood of
your dog doing their business inside again
• Something for them to cuddle up with, like a
blanket or t-shirt that smells familiar (if they’re a
young puppy, something that smells like their
mother or littermates if possible, or something
that smells like you as their new owner)
2. Dog-proof your home
Make sure any breakables and important items are
safely hidden away or out of reach of your pup, to
save them from being chewed or knocked over.
Keep garbage cans out of reach, and stow
cleaning products and medicines up high, away
from inquisitive noses.
Also check that none of your houseplants could be
toxic for dogs – check out the ASPCA’s list of toxic
plants for dogs. Attach cables to the wall or cover
them with chew-proof protective piping, to make
sure your dog doesn’t get a nasty shock, and
assess your home for any other potential dangers.
3. Have a plan for toilet training
Decide where you’d like your dog to do their
business, as it’s a lot easier to toilet train if you
encourage your dog to go in a consistent location
from the beginning – whether this is a spot
outside, or a specific place you keep your indoor
pee pads.
4. Discuss plans as a family/household
You should discuss plans for your new furry family
member together, to ensure everyone is on the
same page when it comes to behavioral matters,
lifestyle choices and who’s responsible for what.
Your dog will feel more comfortable and learn the
rules of the house more quickly if everyone is
consistent and you tend to follow a routine. For
example, if you’re happy to let the dog up on the
couch, but your partner isn’t – it’s better to discuss
this before your pup arrives!
BRINGING YOUR NEW
DOG HOME
PREPARING YOUR HOME
Dog Parenting 101 | Page 5
Meeting the family
Even if your dog has met all the members of their
new household before coming home, they may still
be a little anxious on the day, so it’s best to take
things slow and not overwhelm them. The best way
to introduce a dog to their new home is to gather
everyone together in one room, and with your dog
on a loose leash, let your dog explore and
approach their new humans, rather than everyone
approaching the dog.
Once your dog approaches the family members,
have them give a high-value treat to help cement
the positive association. Make sure to watch your
dog for signs of distress or aggression throughout.
Generally, a wagging tail is a good sign, whereas
a stif tail, ears folded back, pulling away or
growling indicate they are distressed, and you
should remove them from the situation and try
more slowly next time.
Introducing your new dog to other pets
If you have other pets in the household, again,
take things slowly. Ideally, allow your new dog to
explore the home without your other pets present
for about 30 minutes to an hour (you can put your
other pets in a separate room) so the new dog can
explore and get used to the smells prior to
interaction with other pets.
For adult dogs, or if you’re concerned about your
adult dog meeting a new pup, you can introduce
dogs through a baby gate so they can smell each
other but not hurt each other.
If your pets don’t instantly warm up to each other,
give them a few minutes at a time in the same
room to observe and interact with each other, and
if you notice any signs of distress, separate them.
Ofer high value treats to both pets to reward calm
and positive interactions, and try to stay relaxed
yourself. Pets are highly attuned to our own
senses, and often take their own emotional cues
from us.
Exploring the house
Let your dog take their time exploring the house;
they’ll want to smell everything to take it all in! For
younger or more timid dogs, it may help them feel
more comfortable to be introduced to your home
bit-by-bit, by blocking of certain rooms or parts
of a room. Baby gates or play pens can be useful
for this.
Establish a space where your dog can retreat to if
they feel overwhelmed at any point. Position their
crate and bed somewhere quiet, away from the
busier rooms in the home.
Establishing a routine
Try to establish a routine with your dog straight
away. Take them out for walks and feed them at
consistent times. Having a routine is comforting for
dogs, and this will help them settle in more quickly.
In New York City, as in many other locations, it’s
mandatory to register your dog with the NYC
Health Department. If you’ve adopted, your
shelter may already have filed the paperwork for
you, otherwise, it’s best to do this as soon as you
bring your dog home, to ensure you’re complying
with local laws, and to help reunite you with your
dog in the event that they go missing.

SOCIALIZATION
Socialization means ‘learning how to be a part of
society’, and while it’s most important during
puppyhood, you may find you need to socialize a
new adult dog too. Socialization is how dogs learn
about themselves, other dogs, and other species
they will interact with. It’s how your pup will figure
out how to communicate with other animals, and
understand what’s acceptable and what’s not.
Poorly socialized dogs can be fearful, timid, or
aggressive later on, so socialization is an
important part of overall behavioral health.
The critical socialization period for dogs is around
6 to 14 weeks of age. Even though, at this age,
your dog won’t have received their full series of
vaccinations at this point, it’s important to begin
socialization by carrying them outside, introducing
them to other vaccinated dogs, dog-friendly cats,
and lots of diferent (friendly!) people. Toys, treats,
and other high-value rewards (like lots of verbal
praise) will help your puppy associate new friends
as a positive experience.
Get your puppy used to a wide variety of sights,
sounds, noises, smells, and tastes at a very early
age, and they’ll be less fearful and jumpy when
they encounter them as an adult.
You want to make sure your puppy accepts being
touched and handled by a lot of diferent people
to make them less fearful of strangers and more
accepting of vet exams later. The moment you
bring your dog home, start getting them used to
being touched; rub their belly, gently put your
fingers around their mouth, lightly pinch their toes
and between their paw buds, brush their coat and
handle their ears.
The more people who do this (always gently, and
with a great deal of care!), the better – so invite
your family members and friends over for puppypetting, early and often! (We don’t think they’ll
mind.)
And remember, anytime you take your pup to a
new place, or introduce them to a new person or
experience – the groomer, dog park, and of course
the veterinary practice – give them a new toy or a
favorite treat. That way, new experiences will be
associated with positive feelings.
A great environment for your puppy to work on
socialization is at a puppy school or a puppytraining class. In these classes, vaccinated puppies
can learn essential communication skills, become
accustomed to new sights and sounds, and begin
basic obedience training.
• Being touched and petted by strangers
• Meeting young children (under your close
supervision!)
• Meeting a dog-friendly cat
• Meeting vaccinated adult dogs
• Experiencing visitors arriving and leaving
your home
• Visiting other people’s homes
• Traveling in a car
• Hearing the phone ring, loud music, and TV
noises
• Hearing laughter and clapping
• Seeing and hearing trucks, bikes, scooters,
and buses
• Hearing the washing machine, dryer, and
vacuum
• Hearing thunder, fireworks, and sirens
• Getting their paws wet, taking baths, and
becoming accustomed to water
SOCIALIZATION CHECKLIST
Dog Parenting 101 | Page 7
It’s important to start training your dog as early as
possible, to instill good behaviors from the
beginning. Positive reinforcement training is the
most efective training method for both puppies
and older dogs.
What is positive reinforcement?
Positive reinforcement focuses on rewarding your
pet for good behavior, rather than punishing bad
behavior. Giving rewards, whether in the form of
treats, verbal praise, or a loving touch, when your
pet obeys you or behaves well in specific ways
encourages your pet to repeat these actions or
behaviors when given the command. Good
behavior becomes inextricably linked with a
reward.
How dogs think
Before you embark on training your pup, it may be
helpful to know a few things about what’s going
on in their furry head.
First, remember that genetics and behavior both
tell us that dogs are pack animals. Around 15
weeks, puppies begin developing awareness of
pack hierarchy. A set hierarchy – that is, knowing
who the “boss” is, and where they themselves rank
in the pack – gives puppies a sense of stability,
which in turn gives them comfort.
It’s important that your dog knows and
accepts that they are in a loving pack, in
which you are the leader and they are the
follower.
For this to happen, you must begin training as
soon as your dog first enters your home. Although
there are some difering opinions on how to set the
stage for obedience and order, many experts
agree on the following recommendations:
• Do not let your dog sleep in your bed. Instead,
give them their own bed or crate as a place they
can turn to for comfort and safety.
POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT
BEHAVIOR AND TRAINING
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 8
• Don’t reward unwanted behavior. On the
surface, this may sound silly – who gives treats
for bad behavior? But keep in mind that your
attention is actually considered to be a treat. So
don’t acknowledge your dog when they initiate
play or demand attention at undesirable
times. Otherwise, they’ll be learning how to get
what they want, whenever they want.
• Puppy school or dog training classes are
great for laying the groundwork for training
and basic commands. Once your dog can sit
and stay, these actions can be called upon at
any time, which can help prevent many
behavioral problems. But these and other skills
need to be positively reinforced and continued at
home for successful outcomes.
How to use positive reinforcement techniques
At the exact time that your pup displays the
behavior you want, praise and immediately give a
treat. It’s helpful to find out what motivates your
dog most. Some dogs are highly food-motivated,
whilst others prefer a short play session, a favorite
toy, verbal praise or physical afection.
If giving a food-based treat, it should be small and
low-calorie, since you will be giving a lot of them
out: trainer treats, or bits of cut up carrot, apple,
banana, bell pepper, cucumber, strawberry, or
blueberry. Positive reinforcement is only efective
if it’s constant, predictable, and reproducible.
Keep in mind that verbal punishment can result in
fear or aggression toward people or things
associated with the negative experience. That’s
why we prefer positive training methods. And you
should never physically punish your pet, no matter
what: not only can it induce anxiety, it’s also cruel,
leads to a negative relationship with your pet, and
can result in bites (and escalate from there!).
Finally, know that all dogs (like people) learn at a
diferent pace. So be patient, consistent, and
persistent.
Positive Training Takeaways
1. Reward positive behaviors (with praise, treats,
and toys).
2. Ignore unwanted behaviors and demands for
attention.
3. Never physically punish your pet. (If your dog
can sit, get them to stop the unwanted behavior
by having them sit; then reward them for
responding to your command.)
4. Be patient and consistent. It’s the best way to
reinforce good behavior.
Remember, for your dog to be happy and
comfortable in your home, a dependable
hierarchy in which you are the “leader” is
important: it makes your dog feel safe and stable.
But if you want to be the pack leader, that means
that you have to be the one to call the shots. By
rewarding good behavior and completely ignoring
unwanted ones, you can train your dog to be
obedient to your commands – and show them
who’s boss – in a way that’s agreeable for both of
you.
The key to successful housetraining is repetition
and reward. If you’re patient and consistent, it
shouldn’t take you more than a month or two to
teach your dog how to urinate and defecate
outdoors.
HOUSETRAINING
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 9
1. Choose a spot.
Picking a dedicated location for your dog to go
really depends on your individual situation. Is it
outside in the yard? A specific street corner, or a
pee pad in the laundry room? Regardless of where
you choose, that’s the spot you should take your
dog whenever it’s time to eliminate.
2. Be consistent.
In the beginning, you’ll want to take your dog to
the chosen spot every two hours. Once you’re
there, say the same thing to them every time,
whether it’s “Go potty,” “Time to pee,” or “Do your
business.” You may want to associate going to the
potty spot with certain events: the start of a walk,
before or after a meal, after a play or nap session.
A marker or visual aid can also help.
While you’re still teaching your dog where and
when to go, don’t change the chosen location; this
will confuse them. Using the same spot will build
up an odor that your pet will detect and want to
re-mark with their waste.
3. Praise and reward!
Remain quiet and still while your dog is eliminating
– no distractions. But immediately after your pup
pees or poops in the right spot, provide lots of
praise and a special treat. They’ll come to
associate the desired behavior with the treat, and
that’s the best way to encourage them to go in the
right place.
4. Be attentive and aware.
Learn your dog’s signals that they want to go
outside, such as snifng, whining, or pawing at
the door.
Ultimately, providing a set routine is the most
important factor for success. Being consistent
about timing, location, key phrases, and rewards
will provide structure and a relaxed, steady
environment that will be very helpful with
housetraining.
Especially when you’re still trying to establish this
routine, close supervision is essential, and
confinement can be helpful. Close supervision
means you can observe their signals, while
confinement to a small area will limit the locations
in which they can possibly have accidents. Plus,
they’ll be close enough for you to pick up if you
notice them trying to eliminate in an undesirable
location.
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 10
Accidents happen: how to respond
Remember, as the human in this situation, it’s up
to you to be vigilant and help your dog get to the
right bathroom spot. But accidents do happen and
are simply a part of the learning process. Just
keep in mind that there’s a right way and a wrong
way for you to respond.
If you witness your dog in the act of having an
accident indoors, remember that you should
NEVER physically punish them in response. This
could make them afraid of eliminating in front of
people altogether. A loud clap, spray from a water
bottle, or verbal command such as a firm “No!” is
a more acceptable expression of disapproval.
Immediately after they stop eliminating in the
wrong spot, quickly take them to their established
bathroom spot. Once they successfully pee or
poop there, reward them with lots of praise and
treats.
If you did not catch them in the act, ignore the
accident altogether, as this particular opportunity
to correct their behavior has passed. Clean the
area thoroughly and try to neutralize it with sprays
or a cleaning solution, because leaving trace odors
of urine or feces will confuse your dog: only the
“right” locations for eliminating should smell like
waste. Dogs do not like to eliminate in their
sleeping or eating areas, so placing food bowls or
bedding in previously soiled areas (after you’ve
cleaned up) will discourage future accidents in
those locations.
Housetraining is considered “complete” after your
dog has gone 4 to 8 weeks without an accident.
Until then, it might be helpful to keep them within
view at all times, or when you can’t supervise
them, in a small area such as a crate.
We encourage crate training for a number of
reasons, but primarily because it provides a safe
space for your dog when you have to leave them
unsupervised. This is comforting for your pet and
gives you peace of mind, as well.
Child-proof gates, secure cupboards and garbage
cans, and clearing or covering electrical
equipment are good ideas when it comes to
securing your home and pet, but you should
consider using crate training in conjunction with
those safeguards.
CRATE TRAINING
Another bonus? Animals
do not like to urinate or
defecate where they
sleep, especially if it’s a
small space.
This will encourage
your dog to “hold it”
until you’re able to take
them to an established
elimination spot.
Just remember that you
never want your dog to
“hold it” for too long, as
it’s not healthy for them.
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 11
How to crate train:
1. Pick the right crate size.
Choose a crate that’s big enough for your dog to
stand up and turn around in when the door is
closed. However, it shouldn’t be so big that they
feel free to urinate and defecate in it. Think cozy,
but not claustrophobic.
2. Pick a quiet place for the crate.
The crate should be kept in a quiet, calm part of
your home, where there’s not a lot of activity. A
den, spare bedroom, or area with no windows may
be ideal. Of course, not all of us have that option,
so be creative when establishing a separate, quiet
area for your pet’s crate.
3. Introduce your dog to the crate.
Use a command such as “Go to bed” (or even
simply “Crate”) as you guide your dog into the
crate, and use the same command every time. Do
this after an exercise or play session, not when
they have a lot of energy or playfulness. Tempt
them inside using toys and treats, and once they’re
in, give them lots of praise and treats as a reward.
Positive reinforcement at every turn! When you’re
just starting out, you’ll want to stay nearby – you
need to practice crating before leaving them in the
crate on their own for real.
4. Ignore bad behavior.
Especially when you’re just
starting out, your dog will
probably vocalize, whine, and
scratch. Do not acknowledge
this behavior or let them out
in response, because it will
teach them that whenever
they want to be let out of the
crate, they should repeat this
undesirable behavior.
If your dog stops the bad
behavior when you tell them
to, you may release them
from the crate and provide
praise and treats. This step
requires patience – both for you and your pup!
5. Be consistent & observant.
When your dog is in their crate for longer periods
(i.e. when they’re not under your direct
supervision and need to be in their crate), make
sure you let them out every few hours to take
them to their special bathroom spot. If you ever
see them showing signals that they need to go
outside, don’t ignore this.
6. Prepare yourself for possible anxiety.
If your pup is very anxious and showing no
progress with crate training, you can try a special
dog calming collar such as Adaptil. These collars
release pheromones (natural chemicals released
by animals) that have a soothing efect. You won’t
be able to smell them, but some dogs find them to
be calming.
7. Never use your crate for punishment.
Do not use the crate as a “sin bin” or place for
punishment. It is meant to be a safe space for
your pet where they can rest; they should want to
go there. Using it for punishment will create a
negative association with the crate, and they will
begin to resist being confined there.
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 12
Teaching your dog good recall skills is essential.
Knowing they’ll come back when called means you
can give them more freedom to roam and snif on
walks without putting them in undue danger. In
fact, recall is a skill that may even save their life
one day.
A Step-by-Step Guide to Training Recall
Step 1: Introducing recall
Start in a quiet, familiar environment, like your
home. Standing close to your dog, and making
sure they’re focused on you, show them you have
a reward in your hand. Then call “Come!” as
enthusiastically as you can.
When they come, give them the treat, along with
lots of praise and pets. The goal is to teach your
dog that coming to you is the best, most fun thing
imaginable, and good things happen when they
come back.
Step 2: Increase distance
Keep repeating the exercise over the next few days
and weeks, gradually increasing the distance they
must cross to get to you.
distractions, like other people and other dogs that
your dog has to pass on their way back to you.
Note: Make sure this is done in a safe, enclosed
area, like a fenced yard!
Keep your dog on a long leash while practicing
recall outside until you’re sure they’ll come back
when you call, obeying any local laws regarding
leash lengths. Never practice of-leash recall
exercises anywhere there is even a remote chance
that your dog could get hit by a car.
More Tips for How to Achieve Perfect Recall
• Use high-value treats and toys as a reward.
With lots of competing interests and distractions,
you need to really motivate your dog to come to
you. The usual biscuit may not cut it! Try a very
small chunk of cheese or something else you
know your dog loves.
• Set your dog up to win. Help your dog feel
successful by waiting until they’ve had a quick
run around and is already coming back towards
you before calling them to come.
TRAINING YOUR DOG TO COME BACK (RECALL)
If at any stage your dog
doesn’t respond correctly,
reduce the distance between
you until they’re successful,
then increase again slowly.
Also, try to practice at
random times, when your
dog doesn’t expect it, to get
them accustomed to coming
when called at all times.
Step 3: Add distractions
When your dog is coming
every time you call, you can
move your practice sessions
outside and begin adding
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 13
• Don’t repeat yourself. Calling “Come! Come!
Come!” over and over again will just teach your
dog that they don’t have to listen the first time
you call. If your dog doesn’t respond, take a step
back in your training until you’re successful.
• Don’t call your dog for “negative” reasons
only. If you only ever recall your dog to put their
leash back on and go home, they’ll quickly learn
that “come” means the fun is over. To avoid
creating this negative association, make sure to
recall your dog a few times during each play
session, reward them, and then allow them to go
and play again.
Recall in an emergency
If you ever need your dog to come back urgently in
an emergency, don’t chase them. They’ll likely
think it’s a game and keep running away from you.
Instead, try running away from them to incentivize
them to chase you.
Alternatives to off-leash
Some dogs just aren’t great at coming back, and
no matter how much training you do, you may not
feel comfortable letting them of the lead. That’s
okay! Trust your instincts. Dogs still enjoy on-leash
walks, and you shouldn’t feel like you’re depriving
them—you’re being a responsible dog parent and
doing what’s best for them.
Fenced-in dog parks also ofer a great opportunity
for dogs to run around, play, and socialize,
without any worry that they’ll get too far away.
Teaching recall can take months, so stay patient.
Just remember to keep praising every success, no
matter how small.
Finally, one important note to keep in mind: under
no circumstances should a dog ever be allowed of
the leash if they are being walked anywhere near
cars. Of-leash walking is to be reserved for hiking
trails, enclosed parks, and other completely safe
locations. Remember that no matter how good
your dog’s recall skills are, no dog can be trusted
to come back when called 100% of the time. Better
to play it safe than sorry!
Separation anxiety is distress displayed by dogs
when left alone. Dogs get separation anxiety when
they are not capable of comforting themselves.
For some dogs, this happens when a physical
illness causes moderate to severe discomfort, while
others may develop separation anxiety after a
change in environment.
Moving, changes in routine, introducing new
family members or pets, and other adjustments
can all trigger separation anxiety. Dogs recently
adopted from shelters may also develop
separation anxiety (although paradoxically, the
separation anxiety tends to develop 1-2 months
after being brought home).
The signs and symptoms of separation anxiety in
dogs are mostly behavioral.
Dogs with separation anxiety tend to vocalize
when they are left alone by barking, whining, or
howling. Panting and salivation are also common.
SEPARATION ANXIETY
• Excessive panting and salivation
• Excessive barking or howling
• Destructive behavior
• Urination or defecation around the house
SEPARATION ANXIETY SYMPTOMS
Behavior & Training Dog Parenting 101 | Page 14
These signs can begin before separation if dogs
learn to anticipate their owner’s departure.
Vocalization can cause owners trouble with
neighbors or landlords, and accidents within the
house, as well as destructive behaviors like
chewing on door frames, can cause lasting
property damage. Some destructive behavior can
even lead to veterinary emergencies. Consuming
foreign bodies like clothing, cloth, or garbage may
require surgical intervention, adding to dog and
owner stress. Dogs with separation anxiety may
also chew, bite, or lick at themselves excessively,
which can lead to infection.
Preventing or treating separation anxiety
Many of the steps taken to treat separation
anxiety can actually be helpful in preventing it
developing in the first place.
These include:
• Socializing dogs and encouraging positive
experiences with alone time through crate
training or other techniques. Having a “safe
place” like a crate will help your dog comfort
themselves in your absence, and also lowers
their chances of engaging in destructive
behavior.
• Discouraging certain needy behaviors like
scratching or excessively seeking attention, to
help them become more self-sufcient.
• Establish positive associations with your
absence. When you leave your dog alone, give
them a special treat, stufed Kong, or another
high value reward that they don’t get at any
other time.
• Give them something to do to fill the time.
Slow feeding bowls or puzzle toys can provide
your dog with a tasty distraction while you are
gone.
• Stay calm when leaving and returning home.
Although it may be hard to ignore your dog’s
exuberant greeting, giving them too much
attention at these times can heighten your dog’s
anxiety around arrivals and departures.
• Switch up your routine when leaving home. If
you follow the same routine, your dog will pick
up on this and notice those departure cues: the
sound of your keys, putting on shoes, or
grabbing a bag. Mix things up so your dog
doesn’t associate these signals with you leaving
and subsequently with anxiety.
• Increase exercise and play before leaving.
Frequent exercise can help tire your dog out and
stimulate them physically and mentally prior to
time spent alone.
• Never punish your dog for displaying anxiety
or for any behaviors experienced during
periods of anxiety. Punishment is inefective
and only increases your dog’s stress levels.
If you’re worried your dog may be experiencing
separation anxiety, contact us to discuss – we can
help you come up with a plan of action.
If necessary, we can suggest anti-anxiety
medications that may help, along with calming
aids like pheromone collars such as Adaptil or
products like Anxiety Wrap or Thunder Shirts.
Treating separation anxiety takes time, and some
dogs never learn to reliably comfort themselves.
During the training process, consider using

daycare centers, or dog walkers.

NUTRITION
Generally, puppies should be fed three times a
day up to 12-16 weeks, and then slowly weaned to
twice daily feedings. Older dogs should be fed
twice a day.
To avoid an upset stomach, it’s best not to make
any sudden changes to your dog’s diet. If possible,
find out what food they have previously been
eating, and buy a small supply to slowly transition
them onto your preferred food.
How to transition
Slowly decrease the amount of old food, while
increasing the amount of new food over about a
week. For example, if your pup needs 2 cups of
food a day, try the following:
Whether you’re a new puppy mom or a seasoned
dog dad, providing the right nutrition for your pet
can be complicated. There’s a wealth of
misinformation out there, from fad diets to false
marketing and confusing pet food labels. Here are
a few tips and recommendations to help make the
right choice for your pet.
1. Look for an AAFCO statement under the
ingredients list.
If your pet’s food bag has a statement from the
AAFCO (the Association of American Feed Control
Ofcials), it’s a sign that you are of to a good
start. This statement is an indicator of nutritional
adequacy – it means your pet’s diet is balanced
and complete. It’s trickier to find on canned and
wet food, but rest assured it is still there!
2. Don’t dwell on the ingredients.
The ingredients list on a bag of pet food is
complex, but it’s not just science that goes into
these labels. It can be a powerful form of
marketing where manufacturers list ingredients to
catch your eye that may not add nutritional value
for your dog.
Ask your vet to clarify any confusing terms for
you. “Human-grade” has no medical meaning,
and “meat byproduct” can include organ meats
but nothing crazy like hair, horns, teeth, or hooves.
Don’t overthink it!
3. Assess the manufacturer.
This is where our doctors at Small Door are here to
help. If you have not researched where your pet’s
• 1st day: 2 cups of previous food
• 2nd day: 1 ¾ cups previous, ¼ cup new
• 3rd day: 1 ½ cups previous, ½ cup new
• 4th day: 1 ¼ cups previous, ¾ cup new
• 5th day: 1 cup previous, 1 cup new
• 6th day: ¾ cup previous, 1 ¼ cups new
• 7th day: ½ cup previous, 1 ½ cups new
• 8th day: ¼ cup previous, 1 ¾ cups new
• 9th day onwards: 2 cups new food

food is manufactured, you may be missing key
indicators of good nutrition. Here are some
questions we ask:
• Where is the food manufactured? Generally, a
good manufacturer owns the plants where their
food is produced.
• What quality control measures are taken? This
looks at quality of ingredients, consistency and
nutritional value of the end product.
• Do they employ at least one full-time, qualified
animal nutritionist, and does this doctor
formulate the diets?
• Do they conduct and publish research in peerreviewed journals?
• Can they provide nutritional values for any
nutrient, beyond what’s listed on the label?
These are just a few of the questions we ask pet
food manufacturers to ensure that we are
recommending the best diets to our members.
Specific requirements for puppies, large and
small breeds
• Puppies need puppy food. What you feed your
dog as a puppy is really important for their
growth and development. Puppies need more
calories, fat and a diferent vitamin and mineral
balance than adults. Puppy foods account for
these specific nutrition needs. We recommend
feeding puppy food until your dog reaches their
adult size – around 12 months old for small to
medium breeds and 14 to 18 months for large
and giant breeds. When picking out a puppy
food, look for the AAFCO statement and make
sure it says that the diet meets the nutritional
profiles for puppies or all life stages.
• Is your dog a large breed? Large and giant
breed dogs need a more precise calcium to
phosphorus ratio for their growing big bones. If
you have a large breed puppy, make sure their
puppy food is labeled to include large breeds.
• Is your dog a toy or small breed? Use the steps
above and select a “small bite” kibble size. Dog
foods often have versions made specifically for
small dogs and their tiny mouths, to make
chewing easier and make sure they don’t choke.

Here are some pet food brands that our doctors
recommend to suit many diferent lifestyle
choices. Many of these brands also have great
puppy food formulas. Please note that we do not
have a vested financial interest in any of these
foods. They meet the necessary nutrition
requirements from AAFCO, adhere to strict quality
controls, and employ veterinary nutritionists:

At Small Door, we’re here to help tailor your pet’s
diet to your lifestyle as best as possible. It’s
important to prioritize your pet’s health, and there
are some diets that are worth thinking through
before you commit:
Grain free diets
Some ‘boutique’ and consumer-oriented pet food
companies have suggested that grain free diets
are beneficial to your furry friends, particularly
to dogs. It has even been compared to the benefits
of gluten free diets in people, which just isn’t
accurate.
Grain free diets have been linked to an increased
risk of a heart disease, called dilated cardiomyopathy, in dogs. We don’t know enough to say
why this is, but we do know that we should not be
feeding dogs grain free foods.
Raw meat-based diets
The raw diet is another one influenced by pop
culture. It consists of feeding raw meats,
sometimes supplemented with raw fruits,
vegetables, and eggs. The thought process behind
this diet is: dogs’ ancestors ate raw meat, so now
our pets should. Our dogs, however, are not their
ancient predecessors, and we need to consider
how their nutrition has evolved.
There are no scientific studies that prove the
health benefits claimed by supporters of this diet.
In fact, there are many studies showing the
opposite: nutritional imbalances, diet-induced
hyperthyroidism and bacterial infections.
Raw diets can be dangerous for you and your dog.
They pose increased contamination risks from
Salmonella and other bacteria, so they’re not only
a risky choice for pets, but also a public health
risk.
Vegan and vegetarian diets
These diets require careful consideration and can
have some pitfalls. There are a few safe, healthy
vegetables for dogs to eat. But they still need to
get enough protein in their diets, so vegan and
vegetarian lifestyles may not suit them. Talk things
through with your veterinarian before making this
change.
If your dog requires a specific calorie count, we
recommend discussing with us rather than using
an online calculator, as the calculation involves
many factors and can be quite complex.
As for treats, we recommend those with a limited
and easily understandable ingredient list. As a
substitute, try these low-fat and low-calorie
human foods: cut up carrots, apple, banana, bell
pepper, cucumber, strawberries, blueberries, and
ice cubes. If you want to keep your pet busy with a
tasty treat, freeze some peanut butter or lowsodium chicken broth (or even your pet’s wet food)
inside a Kong toy.

FOOD DANGERS
Dog Parenting 101 | Page 20
Dogs need exercise to maintain happy and healthy
lives, just like people do. Your dog’s exercise needs
will vary depending on their age and breed. So, it’s
important to tailor their exercise according to their
stage of life.
Puppies have unique exercise needs. They are
eager and active, but they are also brand new to
the world and to exercising. This means that while
they have huge amounts of energy, they don’t
have the stamina to match.
• Start with shorter play sessions. Puppies get
large bursts of energy followed by long periods
of rest and napping. To hold their attention and
introduce them to exercise, hold a few short
walks or play sessions throughout the day.
• Don’t overwork your puppy. If they’re sleeping,
let them sleep. Too much exercise can be harmful
to your new best friend’s developing mind and
body. Wait until your puppy’s bones and joints
are fully grown, at around one year old, before
making them your running partner. This is
especially important for large breed dogs, as too
much strain from exercise can damage their
delicate cartilage.
• Be mindful of your pup’s safety. Puppies
should not be overexposed to the outside world
until they are fully vaccinated and their immune
system is armed and ready. We recommend
having the majority of your play sessions
indoors. Carrying your pup outside before they
are fully vaccinated is a great way to introduce
them to the sights and smells of their new home
and to tire them out.
• Learn your puppy’s breed. Regardless of their
stage of life, some dog breeds are genetically
and physically built to exercise more than others.
Your 10-week-old Husky, while they may grow to
50 lbs, is still a small puppy right now. Don’t take
them on a strenuous hike that they’ll be able to
tackle in a year or two.
• Make sure you are the one to initiate play and
exercise sessions, not your puppy. This will
prevent them from becoming over-demanding
and hyperactive.
EXERCISE NEEDS
• For their physical health: Dogs need
exercise to stay in shape. Exercise results in
tip-top body condition, from a healthy
weight and muscle tone to a healthy
metabolism.
• For their mental stimulation: Dogs need
as much physical exercise as they do
mental exercise. Physical activity plays a
big part in dogs’ mental states and provides
stimulation for both the body and brain.
• To reinforce positive behaviors and
reduce unwanted ones: Just as exercise
afects dogs’ physical and mental
wellbeing, it also impacts their behaviors.
With ample exercise, dogs are satiated,
leading to fewer destructive behaviors.
• To find a balance: Lack of exercise, as well
as too much of it, can result in poor health
and habits for your dog. Aim to find a
happy medium.
WHY DOGS NEED EXERCISE
EXERCISE
EXERCISE FOR PUPPIES
Dog Parenting 101 | Page 21
When it comes to exercising adult dogs, it’s crucial
to consider their breed and lifestyle. Adult dogs
can perform a larger variety of exercises than
puppies and seniors, so mix things up and have
fun. In general, dogs need a minimum of 30
minutes of exercise each day.
• Less active breeds should get 30 to 60 minutes
per day. This can be as simple as a few leisurely
walks and some indoor playtime. Make sure you
listen to your dog, as these breeds can tire out
rather quickly.
• Flat-faced breeds: A.k.a. brachycephalic, dogs
like Pugs, Bulldogs, and Shih Tzus have a lower
exercise tolerance due to their breathing
constraints. Extreme caution should be taken
with these breeds in hot weather. Even 10
minutes in the sun on a hot summer’s day can be
more than they can handle, as they often cannot
breathe well enough for adequate heat
exchange.
• Toy and small breeds: These little guys can’t
take on as much as larger breeds. They are best
suited to smaller amounts of exercise throughout
the day.
• Large and giant breeds: The biggest of the
breeds are prone to joint and hip issues. Try a
range of exercise that won’t put continual strain
on their legs, like brief hikes and fetch sessions. If
you have a breed that enjoys swimming, this is a
great low impact exercise for your dog.
What tires out a little Pomeranian will barely warm
up an eager Border Collie. High energy breeds
need vigorous physical and mental exercise,
typically 60 to 90 minutes everyday. Adapt their
workout regime to what they do best.
• Sporting breeds: Retrievers, Pointers, Setters,
and Spaniels. These dogs are made for intense
activities. Try taking them for a run, hike, or
swim.
• Herding breeds: Collies, Shepherds, and
Sheepdogs. They are incredibly intelligent and
easily bored. Set up a game of hide-and-seek
using treats to put them in their element.
• Working breeds: Huskies, Bernese Mountain
Dogs, Boxers, and Rottweilers just to name a few.
They thrive with long, consistent exercise. Spend
an hour with them at the dog park, or go for a
longer hike.
EXERCISE FOR ADULT DOGS

The physical and mental health of senior dogs can
be forgotten because of their mobility limitations.
Set your senior dog up for success by giving them
consistent exercise throughout their life. This way,
they’ll stay as healthy as possible into old age.
• Break up exercise. Senior dogs still need at
least 30 minutes of exercise each day. Ofer
shorter walks and play throughout the day.
• Choose low-impact activities. At their stage in
life, senior dogs need more relaxation than
stimulation. Go on walks, not runs. If you have
access to a pool or water, go for a swim. It’s a
great activity that is gentle on their brittle
bodies.
• Evaluate your dog’s weight. If your senior dog
is overweight at all, consider a diet change or
more consistent exercise. Being at a healthy
weight will help reduce as much physical strain
as possible.
• Look into physical therapy. Just like it can help
in people, physical therapy can relieve pain and
discomfort that your senior dog is experiencing.
Water therapy, massage therapy, heat therapy,
and cold therapy are just some of the types out
there.
However old your dog, it’s important to mention
that you shouldn’t let them of the leash in an
unfenced location until they’ve mastered recall in
areas of high-distraction.
Dog parks and dog runs can be an incredible tool
for pet owners, allowing your pup to play with
others and run around in safety. However, it’s
crucial that again, you don’t take your dog to a
dog park until you know they will always come
back to you when called – just in case.
You should also ensure your dog is always within
sight when you’re at the dog park. Even if your
little one loves playing with other pups, others may
not be so friendly. Watch out for signs of distress
or aggression from your dog and others around
them, so you can call your dog back to you
straight away before things escalate.

WELLNESS
Just as dogs need physical exercise, they also
need mental stimulation to stay fit, healthy and
happy. From tracking scents outside, to
concentrating hard on obedience training, or
attempting to get kibble out of a puzzle toy –
tough mental concentration results in a tired,
happy dog.
A dog who lacks stimulation (of either the physical
or mental type) often ends up letting out their
pent-up energy in an undesirable manner, such as
chewing their owner’s socks or destroying a piece
of furniture. This is why it’s so important to ensure
your dog gets plenty of stimulation.
While some may consider toys a luxury, they
actually play an important role in maintaining
your dog’s behavior and wellbeing.
There are hundreds of diferent types of dog toys
on the market. A top tip is to learn your dog’s
preferences and habits, to avoid wasting money
on toys that will collect dust, or be ripped apart in
seconds.
The types of toys you might consider include:
• Chew toys: Dogs have a strong natural instinct
to chew, and by giving them appropriate chew
toys, you reduce the likelihood of your own items
getting destroyed. If your dog is an aggressive
chewer, then soft, stufed toys are best avoided
as the stufng and/or squeaker can pose an
obstruction risk if they swallow it and it becomes
lodged in their intestines. Hard rubber or
reinforced, tough nylon/fabric toys are better
suited for these dogs:
- Kong Extreme
- Tufy's Mega Ring
- Outward Hound Invincible Snake – an
option for aggressive chewers who love
squeaky toys
• Playtime toys: Some dogs love to chase things,
so balls and frisbees are a good bet here. (If your
dog is also a chewer, make sure you only bring
these toys out during active playtime.) Dogs that
love to chase and shake things will also often
love these stufng-free toys that are perfect for
that 'prey' instinct:
- ZippyPaws Skinny Peltz
• Tug toys: If your dog loves to play tug-of-war,
consider rope toys. Unless your pup is a big
chewer, rope toys can be fairly durable, and
some types may be machine washable. However
if your dog likes to chew, rope toys are not
recommended; your dog may ingest the rope,
which can wrap around their intestines and
cause serious harm. In this situation, consider a
tough rubber tug toy, such as:
- Invincible Chains
1. Practice short bursts of obedience training
each day (5-10 min sessions)
2. Move onto tricks when your dog is a pro
3. Make your dog work for their food with a
stufed Kong or a food-dispensing puzzle
toy (see our Toys section below)
4. Play hide and seek
5. Play ‘nose games’ like find the treats
6. Consider teaching them agility

• Comfort toys: Plush toys, squeaky toys and
blankets may help to soothe and bring a sense of
security to some dogs, particularly those who
sufer from separation anxiety.
• Interactive toys: Puzzle toys and feeders can
provide great exercise and mental enrichment for
dogs while being fun:
- Outward Hound Hide a Squirrel
- Trixie Activity Flip Board
- Nina Ottoson Puzzle Toys
Just like children, dogs like new things. By rotating
your dog’s toys, you can make the toys seem
much more interesting! Stash some of your dog’s
toys in a cupboard for a couple of days, and then
swap them over to give your dog something new to
play with.
With regard to chews such as rawhide, bully sticks
and artificial chews such as nylabones, there are
several points to note. The first is that very hard
objects can wear away the tooth enamel over
time, exposing sensitive nerve endings and causing
discomfort for your animal, as well as a pathway
for tooth infection.
The second is that many bully sticks and pigs' ears
have been associated with recalls due to
Salmonella contamination, which poses a health
risk for both pets and humans alike.
Lastly, there is a danger of pieces breaking of
and being swallowed by your pet, posing a
choking hazard or a blockage in the digestive tract
– a serious health concern.
Alternative chew products we recommend are
those that have been vetted by the Veterinary Oral
Health Council as not damaging to teeth. Some of
our favorites include:
• Purina Pro-plan dental chewz
• Tartar Shield Soft Rawhide Chews

bathing and brushing your dog. You may also
decide to use a professional groomer, or learn how
to groom your dog at home.
Whenever you do need to bathe your pet, make
sure you use a pet-specific shampoo, as human
shampoos may irritate your dog’s skin. And after
the bath, dry them as thoroughly as you can,
concentrating on the ears and any skin folds to
avoid infections.
Regardless of the type of coat your dog has, all
dogs should be regularly brushed, as brushing
helps to spread natural oils through your dog’s
coat, helping to keep their fur in good condition,
and keep their skin healthy.
In general, short-coated dogs should be brushed
once a week, whilst long-coated dogs or dogs
whose fur is thick and tangle-prone should be
brushed daily.
Trimming your dog's nails is very important.
Overgrown nails can become stuck in blankets and
carpets, leading to the nail becoming caught and
becoming injured as the dog tries to free itself.
Overgrown nails can also be uncomfortable for
dogs as they will cause deviation of the toes as the
nails hit the floor which also gives them less
traction on wooden or tile floors. Very long, curly
nails can even turn on themselves and become
embedded in the dog's pad, which is extremely
painful and will cause a nasty infection.
Ideally, nails should be trimmed every 4-6 weeks,
however this can vary according to the surface
your dog spends a lot of time walking on. If you
walk your pet on soft surfaces, their nails will need
to be trimmed more frequently compared to city
dogs that spend a lot of time walking on concrete,
which acts as a natural nail file.
There are diferent types of nail trimmers you can
try; your dog may prefer one type over another.
The two main types are:
• Nail clippers
• Nail grinders
Nail grinders can be a great choice, as they create
a soft edge on the nail and are less intimidating for
owners concerned about trimming their pets nails
too short. That being said, many dogs do not like
the vibration of the grinder on the nail or the noise
they can make.
GROOMING
Some dogs require more
extensive grooming than
others, depending on the
texture of their coats, lifestyle
and health. Breeds with long,
curly or thick hair, dogs with
skin conditions and those
that spend a lot of time
getting messy outdoors will
naturally be more demanding
when it comes to bathing &
brushing.
At your first appointment, we
can provide advice in terms
of how often you should be
NAIL TRIMMING
Wellness Dog Parenting 101 | Page 26
How to trim your dog’s nails
Before you reach for the clippers, get your dog
comfortable with you touching their feet and nails.
Try to make it a positive experience, using highvalue rewards, so your dog is more likely to accept
the process with no anxiety.
When you’re ready to start trimming, look for a
vein down the middle of your dog’s nail. If cut, the
vein will cause bleeding and pain. If trimming
white nails, the vein should be easily visible; simply
avoid the tip of the pink vein by cutting or grinding
lower than this.
Black nails can be a bit trickier as this vein is not
visible. For these nails, we recommend trimming
the hook or curved portion only (the skinny tip of
the nail, not the thicker portion). Some dogs will
not have this hook. In these cases, turn their paw
over and look from the underside. You can often
tell the part that is safe to trim (the portion that is
slightly hollow) from the 'meatier' bulk of the nail.
When you start trimming, don’t feel like you have
to trim all the nails at once. If you can only do 2 or
3 at a time before your pet loses patience, you can
always go back another day. The trick is to keep
the experience positive, both for your pet and you!
There are pet-nail-specific clotting powders that
you can apply in the event that you trim a nail too
short and see bleeding. You can also use flour or
cornstarch in a pinch. If you do cut too short, don’t
panic. Nails can bleed a lot, but your dog is not
going to bleed to death! Contact us; we can take a
look to see if your pet needs medical care.
Some dogs’ ears naturally stay clean and healthy,
and rarely need their ears cleaned. Other dogs
need regular cleaning to prevent dirt building up,
which can cause infections. Dogs who spend a lot
of time in the water, and breeds with long dangling
ears, like Basset Hounds and Cocker Spaniels, are
particularly susceptible.
It’s important to regularly check your dog’s ears,
to make sure you catch any issues before they
become serious. Learn what your dog’s ears look
and smell like when they’re healthy (light pink,
relatively odorless, clean and not inflamed). Wellsocialized dogs generally love having their ears
stroked, but if your dog ever pulls away from your
touch, their ears may be causing them pain. If you
notice your dog pawing at their ear or shaking
their head, this also indicates a potential problem.
EAR CLEANING
1. Using a vet-approved ear cleaning solution,
squeeze enough solution into your dog’s
ear to fill the canal and massage their ear
gently for around 30 secs to loosen wax/
debris deep in the canal. Try not to touch
the applicator to your dog’s ear, to avoid
transmitting bacteria.
2. Let your dog shake their head to remove
the solution (this may be a little messy!)
3. Take a cotton ball or piece of gauze and
gently wipe their ear canal. Make sure not
to use Q-tips or anything with a pointed
tip, as they can push dirt deeper or cause
damage to the ear drum.
If your dog seems to be in pain at any time,
stop and contact us for advice. Also, be
careful not to clean your dog’s ears too
frequently, as this can also cause irritation
and lead to infection. Your vet can advise the
most appropriate frequency for your dog's
breed and lifestyle. Also, cleaning an infected
ear can be very painful, so if you suspect an
infection, it’s best for us to examine your pet.
HOW TO CLEAN YOUR DOG’S EARS

When it comes to your dog’s health, the old
saying, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
of cure", definitely holds true. Ensuring your pet
gets regular wellness care (also known as
preventative care) is the key to them living a long,
healthy life. Wellness care covers everything from
vaccinations, heartworm, flea and tick prevention,
nutrition, dental care and regular evaluations of
your pet's overall health, risks of disease or other
health problems.
The cost of prevention is often a fraction of the
cost of treating a disease or problem once it has
become more advanced, and early diagnosis and
treatment of developing problems or diseases
typically increases the likelihood of a successful
outcome.
At Small Door, we take an integrative approach to
wellness care, and will provide personalized
recommendations for your pet’s healthcare,
nutrition, lifestyle and exercise habits during your
dog’s regular wellness exams.
support this claim. And in fact, the diseases they
prevent are irritating at best, and potentially
deadly at worst. Vaccines are also relatively
painless, easy, and cost-efective to administer.
Puppies (along with old or immune-compromised
dogs) are especially vulnerable to diseases
because they have underdeveloped immune
systems. That’s why we begin vaccinating at a
young age. Puppies also initially receive some
immune protection from their mother, but this
doesn’t last for very long. This maternal immunity
can also interfere with the vaccines we administer,
and make them less efective. So, to make sure
puppies acquire a high enough level of antibodies
to be efective, we have to vaccinate them multiple
times – in other words, administer boosters.
Dog vaccines
You may have heard the terms ‘core’ and ‘noncore’ used to describe vaccines. Core vaccines are
those considered essential for your dog’s health,
whilst non-core vaccines are optional, and may be
recommended for your dog depending on their
lifestyle. During your wellness exam, our doctors
will discuss which vaccines are right for your dog.
MEDICAL CARE
VACCINATIONS
Why we vaccinate
Vaccines, also known as
shots, work by exposing
your dog’s immune system
to an incomplete or inactive
strain of infectious agents.
This helps their body build
immune cells that are
specifically designed to
respond efectively when
the real thing comes along.
In recent years, vaccines
have at times been called
‘dangerous’ for a number of
reasons – but there’s little
to no scientific evidence to
Dog Parenting 101 | Page 28
The whole point of vaccinating is to stimulate the
immune system and prepare the body to defend
itself when exposed to the actual disease. As such,
a small subset of animals can experience
undesirable reactions. The majority of these are
mild and will resolve quickly with time and mild
supportive care.
A little bleeding at the site directly after the
vaccination is normal, as is a mild decrease in
appetite and energy. Your pet may be a little sore
at the vaccination site for a few days, or have a
small lump there, but that’s normal, too.
If your pet experiences any of the following
reactions after a vaccination, please contact us:
• Vomiting
• Facial swelling, hives, or excessive itching
• A lump at the vaccination site that lasts more
than a couple of weeks
• Excessive lethargy or a refusal to eat, especially
if it lasts more than a day
Core vaccines
• Rabies: legally required in New York.
• DHPPi: a combination vaccine that protects
against Distemper, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza
and Infectious Hepatitis.
• Leptospirosis: protects against a dangerous
bacterial infection. Whilst some vets do not
consider this a core vaccine, at Small Door we
strongly recommend it for all dogs in New York,
as leptospirosis is found across all five boroughs
and is even more prominent outside of the city.
Non-core vaccines
• Bordetella: prevents kennel cough, and is
required by dog boarding and daycare
facilities.
• Lyme: protects against Lyme Disease carried by
ticks and can be useful for dogs that visit areas
with high tick exposure.
• Canine Influenza Virus: protects against dog
flu.

PREVENTATIVES
Preventatives are regular (usually monthly)
medications that you should give your dog to
protect them from fleas, ticks and heartworm.
There are a number of diferent brands and types
of preventatives, including pills/chewables, topical
medications and injections. Whichever type you
choose, they need to be applied year-round in
order to keep your dog safe.
Fleas are common year-round. They live on dogs,
feeding on their blood and laying eggs in their fur.
The eggs fall of of your pet and into the nooks
and crannies of your house before hatching. When
dealing with a flea problem, not only does your
pet need to be treated but the environment as well.
Washing your pet’s bedding in hot water,
vacuuming and home ‘bombs’ or foggers are all
strategies to help remove and/or kill flea eggs – all
of which are labor-intensive and why prevention is
superior to reaction.
Ticks are most active during the warmer months
and hibernate when it’s very cold out. However, it
is important to note that they’re active during a
wide range of temperatures, so just because it’s
winter, doesn’t mean your dog is not at risk.
Fleas and ticks aren’t just pesky irritations – the
harm they cause can go far beyond mere
itchiness. Ticks can transmit Lyme disease to dogs
and humans (amongst other tick-borne illnesses),
while skin allergies caused or exacerbated by fleas
can lead to sores and infection. Fleas can also
transmit an internal parasite, the tapeworm, which
can cause malnutrition and weight loss in your
pet. Furthermore, the cost of eradicating flea
infestations from your home can be quite high.
Heartworm disease is a serious and potentially
fatal infection in pets. It is transmitted by baby
worms carried by mosquitoes. When the mosquito
bites a pet, the worm enters the bloodstream of
the pet and can grow up to a foot long as it
matures, taking up residence in the heart and lung
blood vessels, damaging the internal organs. It’s a
serious, progressive disease, with few early signs
of infection, so prevention is extremely important.
It’s also necessary to test your dog each year for
heartworm. While heartworm preventatives are
highly efective, they are not 100% foolproof. Not
following a strict schedule of administering
preventatives raises your dog’s risk of infection.
Sometimes pills are not swallowed, or they may be
thrown up. Topical creams can be washed or licked
of. Administering heartworm preventatives to a
heartworm positive dog can also cause a severe,
life-threatening reaction, depending on the extent
of the infestation. This is a key reason heartworm
testing is so important.
Spending a minute or two, once
every month, to administer
preventatives can save you a lot
of time, hassle, pain, and money
down the road. At your first
appointment, we’ll discuss the
diferent types of preventatives
with you, and determine which
suit your dog best.

After you’ve brought your new dog home, we
generally recommend letting them settle in for a
few days before bringing them to the vet. Taking
them for a wellness exam within the first week is
ideal.
From then on, the frequency of wellness exams will
depend on your dog’s age and health. During
puppyhood, frequent check-ups are important to
ensure they’re developing normally, and to provide
them with all of their puppy vaccines. For adult
dogs, wellness exams are recommended every six
months, whilst senior dogs and those with chronic
health conditions may require check-ups more
often.
Adult schedules
If they are otherwise healthy, we like to see adult
dogs for wellness exams twice a year. We conduct
a thorough nose-to-tail exam that looks at
everything from their weight, body condition,
temperature, teeth and gums, ears, eyes, heart,
lungs, down to their paws.
During these exams, we will administer any
vaccine boosters they require, and once a year,
we’ll conduct bloodwork to detect any developing
health conditions as early as possible, plus fecal,
heartworm and tick-borne testing to check for
parasites. We can also trim your dogs’ nails for
you during these appointments.
WELLNESS CARE SCHEDULES
The exact timing of puppy appointments and
vaccines may difer depending on how old
your pup was when you brought them home,
what care they have already received and the
vaccines you choose to give them, but the
below is a rough guide to when we should see
them. We try to space out vaccines to reduce
the likelihood of reactions.
• 8 weeks – First Puppy Visit: Distemper
vaccine (one of three), Bordetella vaccine,
fecal testing and deworming
• 12 weeks – Second Puppy Visit: Distemper
vaccine (two of three), Leptospirosis vaccine
(one of two), Rabies vaccine, fecal testing
and deworming
• 16 weeks – Third Puppy Visit: Distemper
vaccine (three of three), Leptospirosis
vaccine (two of two), fecal testing and
deworming
• Prior to spay/neuter (between 6-9
months): bloodwork and fecal testing
PUPPY SCHEDULES
Medical care Dog Parenting 101 | Page 31
Senior schedules
As your pup gets older, we may need to see them
more often to keep an eye on any health problems.
We’ll discuss any specific requirements and make
a plan together to ensure your dog is making the
most of their golden years.
Vaccine schedules remain the same as adult dogs.
For healthy seniors, we typically test bloodwork
every 6-12 months, whilst dogs with health
conditions may need to be tested every 4-6
months or more frequently.
Unless your dog is already spayed/neutered, you
may have to make a decision about whether to
spay or neuter your pet. While this is a personal
decision, we can talk it over with you to make sure
you have all the information to make an informed
decision.
Why do we spay and neuter?
Overpopulation is a large problem, with millions of
unwanted pets still in shelters, and millions of
healthy dogs having to be euthanized every year.
Spaying and neutering has been statistically
proven to decrease the number of homeless pets. It
also has a number of health and behavioral
benefits for your dog.
Spaying at a young age has been shown to reduce
the occurrence of mammary (breast) cancer and
uterine infections (also known as pyometra). Heat
cycles (menstruation) also typically occur about
every 6 months in mature female dogs. Spaying
eliminates heat cycles and the messes in your
home associated with them.
Neutering prevents testicular cancer and may
prevent some prostate diseases.
Both spaying and neutering may also help prevent
or alter unwanted behaviors, such as aggression,
urine marking and ‘roaming’ (where dogs wander
of in search of a mate).
As with any type of surgery, there are small risks
associated with the anesthetic and surgery itself.
Your veterinarian will discuss these risks with you
based on your pet’s health.
When is the best time to spay?
Most dog spays and neuters are performed
between 6 and 9 months of age. Some recent
studies have shown that spaying and neutering
large breed dogs when they’re older and their
bones are more mature may be beneficial. We can
discuss the right age for your pet’s surgery
together.
Adult and senior dogs need regular vaccine
boosters to maintain immunity:
• Rabies – every three years
• Distemper – every three years
• Bordetella – every year
• Leptospirosis – every year
• Canine influenza – every year
• Lyme disease – every year
VACCINE BOOSTERS
SPAYING AND NEUTERING

Like humans, dogs can develop oral diseases like
periodontal disease and gingivitis, caused by the
buildup of tartar and plaque on your dog’s teeth
and underneath their gums. Over time, these
conditions can lead to pain, inflammation,
infection, tooth decay, and tooth and bone loss.
You can reduce the amount of plaque and tartar in
your dog’s mouth by regularly brushing your dog’s
teeth with a doggy toothpaste.
Keep in mind that oral health isn’t just about
preventing tooth decay. The more serious issues
have to do with periodontal disease. Plaque and
bacteria can enter your dog’s bloodstream, which
can afect other organs like your dog’s heart, liver,
and kidneys. Maintaining good oral hygiene for
your dog will reduce this risk and improve your
dog’s overall health.
How often should you brush your dog’s teeth?
Ideally, you should brush your dog’s teeth every
day. Regular tooth-brushing removes particles of
food and bacteria that cause plaque and tartar
development, and gives you a regular opportunity
to inspect your dog’s mouth. This can help you
catch problems like fractured teeth or gum issues
before infections set in.
Finding the right toothbrush
There are several diferent types of toothbrushes
suitable for dogs. The most common are:
• Finger brushes
• Children’s toothbrushes
Finger brushes are rubber or silicone brushes that
slide over your finger like a finger puppet. These
brushes are suitable for all dogs and can be great
for training, as you have more control over the
brush. However, enthusiastic dogs may bite down
on it accidentally – with your finger inside.
Perhaps the best toothbrush for dogs is a regular
human toothbrush. Children’s toothbrushes or
small-headed toothbrushes with soft bristles work
well for large and small breed dogs alike. The soft
bristles clean canine teeth without causing
discomfort. Some dogs even seem to enjoy electric
toothbrushes!
Dental chews are sold in most pet stores and can
be used as an occasional treat, but they don’t
clean as efectively as regular toothbrushes or
finger brushes, and add unnecessary calories to
your dog’s diet. Consult your veterinarian about
how to make dental chews a part of your dog’s
oral hygiene practice. As with all chews, they
should be given under direct supervision only to
minimize the risk of your pet swallowing large
chunks, causing a choking hazard.
Toothpaste for dogs
Human toothpaste is dangerous for dogs and
should never be used to brush your dog’s teeth.
Some human toothpastes even contain the
sweetener xylitol, which is safe for humans but
extremely toxic to dogs, even in very small
amounts. Instead, use a pet toothpaste. They’re
safe, specially designed for animals, and come in
flavors your dog will enjoy, like peanut butter or
chicken.
DENTAL HEALTH
Medical care Dog Parenting 101 | Page 33
Just like any new activity, teeth brushing requires
patience and training. Luckily, the taste of doggy
toothpaste acts as its own reward. It’s designed to
be ingested, so you don’t need to worry about
convincing your dog to spit it out – much more
difcult is convincing your dog not to chomp on
the toothbrush itself!
Before you start, here's what you need to know:
• Focus on the outside of your dog’s teeth, not the
inside as this is where the majority of tartar
tends to accumulate.
• Use slow, gentle strokes
• Do not force your dog’s mouth open – this can
make them frustrated and you may lose their
cooperation
First, let your dog taste a small amount of
toothpaste. Most dogs will find this enticing
enough to hold their attention. Then, using your
finger only as the ‘brush’, gently rub the
toothpaste onto your dog’s teeth and gums to get
them accustomed to the process.
Once your dog is used to this, which may take a
week to a month, you can progress to using a
piece of gauze to rub against the teeth, getting
them used to the rubbing feeling. Next, put a peasized amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush or
finger brush. Gently lift one side of your dog’s
upper lip and brush in small, circular motions for a
few strokes. Stop, praise your dog, and repeat
these steps until you have brushed the outside of
all their teeth.
Some dogs enjoy brushing more than others. Your
dog may tolerate brushing immediately, or it may
take days or even weeks to get them comfortable.
Take things slow to keep the experience stress-free
for your dog: you may find that you are only able
to brush a few teeth or make one pass over their
teeth when you first begin. This is totally normal.
We encourage you to brush your dog’s teeth
before either breakfast or dinner. This way they
learn that after having their teeth brushed, they
get the ‘treat’ of their meal, providing positive
reinforcement to the activity of tooth brushing.
Unfortunately, some dogs never learn to tolerate
tooth-brushing. Wiping a piece of gauze over
these dogs’ teeth two to three times a week can
still remove plaque and bacteria and improve oral
health. You can also ask your veterinarian for
assistance at your next check-up.
Watch our tooth brushing demonstration video to
see this process in action.
Does my dog still need a dental cleaning if I
brush their teeth?
Yes. Brushing reduces the amount of tartar,
plaque, and harmful bacteria in your dog’s mouth,
but it doesn’t entirely eliminate them. Even with
brushing, your dog will still need dental cleanings
periodically, just as people do. Your vet can
thoroughly clean your dog’s teeth and gums, and
also look for cavities, fractures, and other dental
issues.
Brushing your pet’s teeth is worth it.
It may not be fun for either of you, but brushing
your pet’s teeth will pay of in the long run, saving
you money and saving your pet a lot of pain. And
remember, if you’re having trouble with toothbrushing, contact us for more tips and advice.
HOW TO BRUSH YOUR DOG’S
TEETH
Medical care Dog Parenting 101 | Page 34
If your dog has not yet been microchipped, we
recommend getting it done as soon as possible
after you bring them home. Microchipping vastly
increases the likelihood of reuniting with a lost
dog, as collars and ID tags are not foolproof. It’s
equally important to make sure the microchip
record is kept up to date with your current contact
information.
While pet insurance is a personal decision, we do
recommend that pet parents strongly consider
getting it for their dog. For $30 or so per month, it
could save you thousands of dollars in treatment
costs, and knowing that your pet’s vet bills are
covered in the event of unexpected illness or injury
can provide great peace of mind.
Diferent pet insurance policies can vary greatly,
so it’s important to always read the details
thoroughly, research and compare policies before
purchasing. A good resource you can utilize is
www.pawbamacare.com where you can compare
insurance plans to better understand your
coverage needs.
How does pet insurance work alongside Small
Door membership plans?
Pet insurance is designed to help cover the cost of
the unpredictable, and so typically covers (either
the total or a percentage of) expenses related to
injuries or illnesses.
It typically does not cover wellness or regular
preventative care to keep your pet healthy, such
as annual vaccines, exams, wellness bloodwork or
other testing, or monthly flea, tick and heartworm
preventatives. That’s where Small Door plans come
in.
If you have any questions about whether pet
insurance is right for your dog, reach out to us –
we’re more than happy to help chat you through
the decision.

At Small Door, we do everything we can to help
your dog have stress-free visits, and even enjoy
coming to see us. If your dog does get anxious
easily, there are also a number of things you can
do to help develop a positive vet experience.
• Socialization is crucial. Acclimating your dog
to diferent sounds, smells, people, and animals
as early as possible can help them create
positive behavior traits. And that translates to
easier, more positive vet trips for you, your dog,
and your vet.
• Get it out before the visit. This goes for both
energy and potty! Engage in some vigorous play
with your dog or go for a nice long run with them
before you head to the practice, to use up any
excess nervous energy. Also (provided your dog
doesn’t need to provide a urine sample at the
practice), give them a few extra potty breaks on
the way, to help minimize stress for them.
• Create positive associations with the
practice. If you’re ever walking by the practice
one day, bring your dog in! We love saying hi to
all of our members, and we can give your dog
some cuddles and treats to help them associate
the practice with positive experiences, to make
them feel more comfortable when they need to
stop by for an exam.
• Join us for events. This also creates positive
associations with the practice that are not
related to medical needs.
If you know your dog gets very distressed by vet
visits, contact us. We can help make special
arrangements, like organizing your visit for an ofpeak time; taking your dog straight through to the
exam room instead of spending a few minutes in
the waiting room; or discussing whether antianxiety medications and calming collars may be
appropriate.
DEVELOPING A POSITIVE VET
EXPERIENCE
• Use a carrier. If your dog
is small enough, use a
carrier to transport them.
The carrier will protect
your pup from other pets
and distractions, and
provide a safe space
where they’re comfortable.
Lining the carrier with a
blanket or toys that smell
like home can also help
calm your dog in an
unfamiliar setting. (Of
course, if your pet hates
their carrier, that’s a
diferent story. You can be
the judge of whether
they’d be calmer in your
arms.)

COMMON PROBLEMS, AND
WHEN TO SEEK HELP
From time-to-time, your dog may experience
minor episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or go of
their food temporarily, but this does not always
mean there is cause for concern. With their
inquisitive nature, dogs may often snafe a piece
of food of the street that doesn’t agree with them.
Puppies can also be particularly prone to stomach
upsets. But nonetheless, incidences like this are
worrying.
Remember – as a Small Door member, we’re here
for you 24/7 via the app. You can chat to us for
immediate advice whenever you have concerns
about your dog. We can discuss your dog’s
symptoms and help you determine whether it’s
safe to monitor them at home, or whether you
should bring them in for an exam.
If you ever notice signs of sickness, or your dog
begins behaving diferently, we want to hear
about it, even if you think your dog is completely
fine. However, we hope the below helps to put your
mind at ease in terms of what may be considered
normal, and what may signify a medical concern.
Vomiting
Vomiting is never fun for your dog, but thankfully it
isn’t always a cause for concern. If your pup has
only vomited once or twice, and otherwise seems
bright and and stable, it’s safe to keep a close eye
on them and wait to see how things develop. We
recommend not giving any food for the next few
hours (water is fine), and when you do reintroduce
food, try a small portion of something fairly bland
to see if they can hold it down. Boiled chicken and
rice/pasta in a 50:50 ration is a good option for a
few days until their GI system is back on track.
If however, your dog has vomited more than a few
times, is vomiting blood, is retching without
bringing anything up, seems lethargic, isn’t eating
or there’s a chance they may have swallowed
something they shouldn’t have (e.g. a sock), you
should bring them in to be evaluated.
Common problems, and when to seek help Dog Parenting 101 | Page 37
Diarrhea
As with vomiting, if your dog has only had
diarrhea a few times and seems otherwise bright
and stable, it’s safe to keep a close eye on them.
The same recommendations apply in terms of food
and water.
If you notice any lethargy, blood, persistent
diarrhea (more than 3-4 times within 24 hours), or
straining, you should bring them in to be
evaluated.
Not eating
Puppies in particular are notoriously picky with
food, and it's quite normal for dog’s appetites to
come and go somewhat as they are growing, or on
a particularly warm day. If they’re otherwise
acting normally and are still playful, bright and
alert, it’s safe to keep a close eye on them.
You can try playing with your pup’s diet a little to
entice them to eat. You could try mixing in a
topper such as steamed or boiled chicken breast,
softening their kibble with some hot water about
30 minutes before feeding or try a soft food from
the same brand. If they are teething, the soft food
may be more comfortable for their mouth or they
may prefer the texture of the wet food. As with any
food change, make sure to make the change
slowly over about a week to avoid any tummy
upset.
If you notice any vomiting, diarrhea, other
concerning symptoms, or your pup hasn’t eaten
anything for over two days, we should examine
them.
Eaten chocolate, grapes, raisins, sugar-free
products containing xylitol
These are all items that are toxic for dogs, and as
individual sensitivity may vary, there is no real
‘safe amount’ that all dogs can consume. We
recommend you contact us immediately for advice
regarding your particular situation.
Coughing
Dogs can cough for a number of diferent reasons,
and some are more serious than others. If you
notice any lethargy, distress, labored breathing or
fast breathing, a blue tinge to the tongue/gums, or
they aren’t eating, we should see them as soon as
possible.
Lump or bump
There are many reasons a pet may have developed
a lump ranging from an allergic reaction, a pimple,
or something more serious. If the lump is at the site
of a recent vaccine (within the last two weeks), it
may be a small reaction to
the vaccine, which is not a
cause for concern.
If the lump appears painful,
your dog seems bothered
by it, or you’ve noticed it
has changed in size or
appearance, you should
bring your dog in for an
exam.
Nail cut too short
Nails that are broken or cut
too short can seem to bleed
a lot, but don’t panic, as it’s
usually not as bad as it
seems. If the nail is still
Common problems, and when to seek help Dog Parenting 101 | Page 38
you should bring them in so we can help.
Not urinating
If your dog is urinating less than usual, this may
be due to environmental factors (a hot day, or
insufcient water intake). Make sure they have
plenty of fresh water and encourage them to drink.
You can also ofer them an ice cube or two – most
dogs love them as a crunchy treat!
If your dog is not urinating at all, you notice any
straining, blood in the urine, or your dog seems to
be in pain or uncomfortable (pacing/straining/
whining/licking at hind end), you should bring
them in as a matter of urgency. ‘Blockages’ such
as bladder stones or UTIs can have serious
consequences, and are best treated as soon as
possible.
Hiccups
Hiccups are involuntary contractions of the
diaphragm – the muscle that separates the chest
from the diaphragm. They can be brought on by
eating or drinking too fast, energetic play or fast
breathing. They can be quite tickly but are not
anything to be concerned about, and are more
common in puppies due to their high energy and
excitement levels. Most hiccup spells only last a
few minutes, and while adorable, do not appear to
bother most dogs!
bleeding, you can try putting
a pea sized amount of flour
or cornstarch on a paper
towel or cotton ball, then
applying it to the bottom of
the nail and holding it there
for a few minutes. Make sure
not to rub the flour in, as this
disturbs the clotting process.
You can repeat this a few
times and often it’ll stop the
bleeding on its own.
If the bleeding doesn’t stop
after five minutes, the cut
nail is still dangling/attached
and you can’t remove it, or
your dog seems to be in pain,
In general, if your dog displays any of the
below, we’d like to hear about it:
• Lethargy (without known cause, e.g. a long
walk that has tired them out!)
• Repeated episodes of vomiting or diarrhea
• Not eating or eating less than usual for two
days or longer
• Excessive thirst
• Difculties urinating or urinating more than
usual
• Not pooping, or unusual stool
• A new lump (without known cause, e.g.
vaccination site) or change to an existing
lump
• Changes to eye appearance
• Sudden weight loss
• Excessive scratching
